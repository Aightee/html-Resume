  Within 3 years of working as a Digital designer I grew into the role of Creative team lead.
  Taking the responsibility of driving the design team of 6 people. Interpreting briefs from
  start to finish, conceptualizing and communicating briefs from management to the creative team,
  also collaborating with interfacing departments like developers, printers,
  Photographers and copy writers to achieve set goals of driving visibility and sales.
  <br />

  Lead the companies most important marketing projects with none over time or budget.
  Innovated solutions that improved creative productivity by 150%. It used to take hours to create
  repetitive tasks like social media banners especially during campaigns, I automated this procedure
  by linking Microsoft XL to Figma to automate and reduced the time drastically.
